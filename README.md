Website for Massachusetts Compassionate Drug Policy Coalition.

## Mision Statement
Historically, we have met drug use with fear and aggression. We know these methods do not stop drug use, they only penalize it, and the most vulnerable among us pay the price. It's time to embrace an attitude of compassion and decriminalize all drugs in the state of Massachusetts.
